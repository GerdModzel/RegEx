/* Unit tests for the NfaBuilder do little more than reimplementing the logic of the NfaBuilder::visit() functions.
 * Compared to the integration test in testFind.cpp, they only save the dependency on the ExpressionBuilder.
 * It was therefore decided to drop these tests; the tests in testFind.cpp are sufficient.
